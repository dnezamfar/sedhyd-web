* **Kristina Swallow
Kristina Swallow, P.E., ENV SP, F.ASCE
ASCE President 2018

Kristina Swallow is the past president of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). Kristina is a civil engineering leader with more than 
twenty years of professional practice in water resources, transportation, and land development. Among her many past roles, she served as Region 8 Director, 
Region 8 Governor, Chair of the Education Activities and the Diversity and Women in Civil Engineering committees, and ASCE's 150th Anniversary Steering Committee.  

Kristina has a diverse professional background that includes serving as a program manager in the capital improvements division for the City of Las Vegas, 
as a transportation policy advisor for a U.S. Senator in Washington, D.C., and working as a land development consultant in the fastest growing city in the 
United States, including five years as a small business owner.She is passionate about civil engineering and the benefits of infrastructure for communities, 
especially transportation systems. 

She is married to a civil engineer, Dave, and has two dogs. In her spare time, she enjoys running, aerial acrobatics, exploring new cities, and just trying new things.


* **Dr. Laren Hay
Dr. Lauren Hay

Dr. Lauren Hay has worked for the USGS since 1986. She is currently a research hydrologist residing in the Earth Systems Modeling Branch of the 
Integrated Modeling and Prediction Division of the Water Mission Area in Denver, Colorado. Prior to that she was the lead scientist for the 
Modeling of Watershed Systems research group for the now defunct National Research Program. Her research has the broad goal of understanding 
precipitation-runoff processes and developing improved hydrologic models.

* **Dr. Annadale
Dr. Annadale

Dr. Annandale has more than forty years of experience as a civil engineer specializing in water resources engineering.  He offers services in the 
fields of hydrology and hydraulics, scour of rock and sustainable development of water resource infrastructure, focusing on reservoir sedimentation 
management, dam safety and climate change assessment.

He has published numerous peer-reviewed papers and is author and co-author of five books on sedimentation and scour. He was named by International Water 
Power and Dam Construction as one of 20 engineers who globally made a significant contribution to dam engineering. 

He is known for his expertise in reservoir sedimentation management, having authored one of the first books on this topic, having co-developed the 
Life Cycle Management Concept for the World Bank, and having globally worked on numerous reservoir sedimentation management projects. The first book 
he authored, entitled "Reservoir Sedimentation", deals with technical aspects of sediment deposition, while the books "Quenching the Thirst", 
"Reservoir Conservation: The RESCON Approach" and "Extending the Life of Reservoirs" focus on sustainable management of water resource 
infrastructure; addressing the effects of climate change and reservoir sedimentation on water and power supply reliability.
