# About the Conference
The first Federal Interagency Sedimentation Conference (FISC) convened in 1947, and the first Federal Interagency Hydrologic Modeling Conference (FIHMC) convened in 1998.  Because these two conferences had similar and overlapping content and participants, organizers combined them into a single highly successful joint conference for the first time in 2006.  The second and third SEDHYD conferences followed in 2010 and 2015.  As a result of all these conferences, 3,000 papers have been published through the conference proceedings, which are available at https://acwi.gov/sos/pubs/index.html 

The SEDHYD 2019 Conference again brings together federal and non-federal scientists, engineers, and managers from various natural resources disciplines. Papers include recent accomplishments in research and technical developments in the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of sedimentation. Papers also describe the development and use of numerical models addressing issues of water quality and quantity, and sediment erosion, transport, and deposition.  The conference uses mixed formats, including formal presentations, poster sessions, mini-workshops and model demonstrations.  Organizers also plan a competition for the best student paper.

**Conference Theme:**
Improving Resiliency and Sustainability of Watershed Resources and Infrastructure

# Who Should Attend
Federal, state, and local agency personnel, consultants, researchers, equipment manufacturers, and service suppliers associated with hydrologic, hydraulic, sediment transport, or non-point source pollution modeling; and those involved in water-resources, water supply, or water-conservation assessment or management.
